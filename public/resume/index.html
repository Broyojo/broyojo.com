            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>T20 Prep Academy</strong><br>
                <i>Python and Java Tutorer</i> - Summer 2023<br>
                I tutor middle school and high school students about Java and Python programming 4 times a week, for 1 and a half hours each lesson.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <strong><a href="https://rialtic.io">Rialtic</a></strong><br>
                <i>Machine Learning Intern</i> - Summer 2022 to Summer 2023<br>
                I was tasked to create fictional patient medical histories to help other software engineers in the company test their code. To accomplish this, I trained a generative transformer model to generate fictional medical histories from real ones. This effort culminated in a model which understands how medical histories are structured and one that could be used to predict future diagnoses for patients. For this project, I used Huggingface Transformers as well as PyTorch.

                With the closing of Dr. Ann Jin Qui's practice, she tasked me with sending out automated SMS texts, phone calls, and emails to her thousands of patients. I automated this process through Amazon SWS and Twilio, writing the <a href="https://github.com/Broyojo/sms">project</a> in the Go programming language.
